## SEB - AREA OF RECTANGLE

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program using class named Rectangle constructed by a length and width, has 2 methods.

1. setvalues - to set the values of length and breadth

2. a method which will compute the area of a rectangle.

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Input the length and breadth of the rectangle.
3. Calculate the area using the formula: length * breadth.
4. Print the area.
5. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM

```

length=int(input())
breadth=int(input())
area=length*breadth
print(area)

```
